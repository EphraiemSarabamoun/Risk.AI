# Project Contribution Guide for Codex and Other Agents

Welcome! This file provides guidelines for AI agents (such as Codex) and human contributors to work together effectively on this project. Please read and follow these instructions when making changes.

## Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

## Branching and Pull Requests
- Work directly on the default branch (usually `main` or `master`). Do not create new branches.
- Separate your work into small, focused commits with clear messages.
- After committing your changes, create a pull request describing the modifications. Include any testing commands and their outputs in the PR description.

## Testing
- If the repository includes test scripts or linting tools, run them before each commit. Document the commands and results in the pull request.
- If tests cannot be executed due to missing dependencies or network restrictions, mention this in the PR.

## Coding Conventions
- Adhere to any existing coding style or conventions in the project. If unsure, follow standard practices for the language in use.
- Include docstrings or comments where helpful to explain complex logic or design decisions.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` or other relevant documentation when you introduce new features or significant changes.

## Communication
- Keep commit messages and pull request descriptions concise and informative.
- Document any limitations, TODOs, or follow-up tasks clearly within the code or documentation.

Thank you for contributing!
